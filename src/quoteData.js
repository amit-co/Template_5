            "Lovely setting on marina. Excellent chef, food delicious, presentation stylish and interesting. Our waitress was charming while being professional and efficient. Among our party of four we enjoyed chicken, squid and the signature dish beef Espetada. It's great to enjoy the South African slant on food and flavours too. I recommend",
